Text Guide:

### Building the website

1. Fork this repository
2. Name it whatever you want. This name will show up in the link you send to the victim. This will show up as `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`
3. Go to the `media` folder and click upload media. Upload two files. One named `video.mp4` and one named `preview.gif`. The gif should be the bait img/gif that you want to show up. The video should be the video that you want to play when the victim clicks the link. Click commit changes.
4. Open index.html and edit line 6 and 10. Replace your-username/your-repo-name with your username and repo name.
5. Click commit changes in the top right and then commit changes again.

### Deploying the website

1. Go to the settings tab of your repository.
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
3. Change the branch to `main` and the folder to `/root`. Then click save.
4. Now wait a few minutes and then click the link that shows up in the GitHub Pages section. This is the link that you will send to the victim.
